This is a Kaggle House Price Prediction Competition - House Prices: Advanced Regression Techniques.
In this I have first performed EDA to gain insights of data. I have found that missing values played important role in sale_price so I didn't drop them. Instrad of droping I have handeled them category wise i.e. numerical , categorical and temporal values.
Then I applied feature selection using Lasso method. 
In last I have trained data using Linear Regression method and got 89% r2 score value.
